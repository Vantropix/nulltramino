## FAQ
### What's different?
- Nothing right now, it'll take time to work out how the game works and how i should go about making it as good as i possibly can.

### Is it worth using Nulltramino?
- No, there's no reason to use this version over the official at this time. Later this might change to a "yes but" or eventually a "absolutely!". I will only be honest.

### Why the name Nulltramino?
- There are several meanings behind the name. 1st. N**ulltra**mino has ultra with a double ll in it, sounds cool and is distinct enough while making it obvious it's a fork of NullpoMino if you already know about NullpoMino. 2nd. tra for Trans. The game is transformed into something new and more fluid, signifying that the game is indeed different. 3rd. I am also trans and like the sneaky tra in the name :)
